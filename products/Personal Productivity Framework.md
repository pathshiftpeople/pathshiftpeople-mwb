# Personal Productivity Framework

![[productivity-pyramid.jpg]]

The Personal Productivity Framework does two things:

* helps you design a personal productivity system that meets *your* unique needs, rather than training you in someone else's. 
* ensures the resulting system saves you more time than you actually spend developing it.

No prior knowledge is required, and the course is **technology-agnostic.** However we will show you the specific tools we use to illustrate the general principles of the framework, and you can always quiz us about them if you take the "Q&A" version.

There are two versions of this course:

* **Version 1**: an on-demand series of videos setting out the basic personal productivity framework. 
* **Version 2**: the same content as version 1, above, but with a Q&A session with one of us, held twice a week at EU- and US-friendly times.

**Coming soon on Gumroad.**

These courses are also excellent preparation for our more advanced productivity courses, and so give you **discounts for:** 

* [[Boost your personal productivity with AI]]
* [[Growing into Obsidian]]
* Smarter, Faster, Better With ChatGPT
