# Boost your personal productivity with AI

Building on the above Personal Productivity Framework, this course helps you integrate large language models and other AI tools into your own personal productivity system, rather than training you in someone else's (which will probably be out of date within 3 months). 

No prior knowledge of personal productivity systems or any AI tool is required. There are two versions of this course:

- those familiar with personal productivity techniques and tools should take **version 1**
- **version 2** *combines* version 1, above, with _free_ access to version 1 of our Personal Productivity Framework course, which sets out a "baseline" What, Why and How of personal productivity systems

While the course is technology-agnostic, we're using our own productivity systems and ChatGPT to provide examples, so there'll be plenty of opportunities to pick up new tools and tips.

**Coming soon on Gumroad.**

This course gives you a **discount for the following courses:**
