**If you've ever been tasked with the development of your organisation's communication strategy and been bewildered and perplexed by the sheer variety of tactics out there, the Communications Strategy Framework is for you.**

The Communications Strategy Framework demystifies communication strategy, There are four courses available. All explain the Framework and help you apply it to your organisation:

* **version 1:** you will create an Executive Summary of your organisation's external communications strategy, working in your own time using the provided videos, texts and downloads
* **version 2:** like version 1, but with an additional live Q&A with Mathew to help you through it
* **version 3:** you will create a much more detailed Full Strategy, along with useful internal communications tools to magnify buy-in across your organisation, working in your own time using the provided materials
* **version 4:** like version 3, but with a live Q&A with Mathew to help you through it.

Versions 1-3 also come with a discount to any higher-level version of this course.
