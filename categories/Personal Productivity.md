# Personal productivity

**Whatever your personal productivity routine and toolkit, these courses will help you improve them.**

No prior knowledge or technical knowhow is required, and we offer a 30-day full refund, no questions asked.
## Personal Productivity Framework

The Personal Productivity Framework does two things:

* helps you design a personal productivity system that meets *your* unique needs, rather than training you in someone else's. 
* ensures the resulting system saves you more time than you actually spend developing it.

No prior knowledge is required, and the course is **technology-agnostic.** However we will show you the specific tools we use to illustrate the general principles of the framework, and you can always quiz us about them if you take the "Q&A" version.

There are two versions of this course:

* **Version 1**: an on-demand series of videos setting out the basic personal productivity framework. 
* **Version 2**: the same content as version 1, above, but with a Q&A session with one of us, held twice a week at EU- and US-friendly times.

**Coming soon on Gumroad.**

These courses are also excellent preparation for our more advanced productivity courses, and so give you **discounts for:** 

* Boost your personal productivity with AI
* Personal Productivity & Obsidian 
* Smarter, Faster, Better With ChatGPT

## Personal knowledge management: Growing into Obsidian (subscription)

Obsidian is freemium software for personal knowledge management. While simple to use, the huge number of plug-ins developed by its dynamic developer community means it "squares the circle": being both user-friendly and easy to learn, *and* as powerful as you could possibly want.

Obisidian users organise their knowledge in "Vaults", so in the first few videos, to be released in April 2024, Pete and Mathew will introduce two or more "Starter Vaults" which subscribers can download and open with Obsidian so they can get started quickly.

Two more videos will then follow each month as Pete and Mathew explore different ways subscribers can develop their own personalised approach to personal knowledge management. 

In this short video Mathew quickly shows Pete a preview of his Starter Vault, concentrating on the Single Best Thing he loves about Obsidian, and they discuss the approach they'll take:

Users can subscribe at any time to access all previous videos and posts, and can cancel at any time. Moreover, subscribers who sign up before July 2024 get a 50% discount *for life*.

## Boost your personal productivity with AI

Building on the above Personal Productivity Framework, this course helps you integrate large language models and other AI tools into your own personal productivity system, rather than training you in someone else's (which will probably be out of date within 3 months). 

No prior knowledge of personal productivity systems or any AI tool is required. There are two versions of this course:

- those familiar with personal productivity techniques and tools should take **version 1**
- **version 2** *combines* version 1, above, with _free_ access to version 1 of our Personal Productivity Framework course, which sets out a "baseline" What, Why and How of personal productivity systems

While the course is technology-agnostic, we're using our own productivity systems and ChatGPT to provide examples, so there'll be plenty of opportunities to pick up new tools and tips.

**Coming soon on Gumroad.**

This course gives you a **discount for the following courses:** 

* Personal Productivity & Obsidian 
* Smarter, Faster, Better With ChatGPT

## Your instructors

**Mathew Lowry** developed the Personal Productivity Framework when he decided to go freelance in 2015, and found himself juggling 10 different clients at once while developing [myhub.ai](myhub.ai), which launched in 2020 and had GPT integration in 2023. And by then he had met...

**Pete Kaminski**... something about personal productivity and AI.
