## Wendy Elford
Dr Wendy Elford is a 'practical futurist' with a penchant for design strategy and knowledge design. She's committed to cultivating sustainable systems within the realms of health, education, businesses, and communities, while maintaining a focus on inclusive, human-centric, and user-centred design. Wendy teams up with other designers and business leaders to maintain a holistic view of the product context, tracking real-time outcomes from prototype to final utilization scenarios.  
  
Her unique approach is rooted in complex adaptive systems, using text, large language models, observation, and narratives as data to inform the design process.
