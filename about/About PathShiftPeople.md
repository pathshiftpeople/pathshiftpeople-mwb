# About PathShiftPeople

**Path Shift People is a small community of experts focused on helping companies and individuals grow and thrive in our changing world.**

We are building a community which will help hold you steady as the AI wave crashes over us all. We come from a variety of backgrounds, but have a few things in common:

* we're all *shifting paths* in response to AI and other technological changes
* we're all learning how to integrate AI into our respective fields
* we all have things to learn from each other
* we want to share our journey with others, and in the process learn from them.

Our current offerings include recorded courses, live seminars, 1-to-1 coaching, and consulting services, but our model is constantly evolving so check out:

* our Home Page and [[Products A-Z]] sets out our catalogue, listing currently available products and services
* our [[Frequently Asked Questions]] and [[Blog]], where we share our journey
* [[Frequently Asked Questions#How do I contact you?|how to contact us for more details]].
