## What is PathShiftPeople?

**We set up PathShiftPeople so all of us can help all of us navigate the shifts ahead.**

When the one constant is change, when the ground never stops moving under your feet, only one essential skill remains: navigating path shifts. So we created PathShiftPeople to help people help each other do just that.

See [[About PathShiftPeople]]

## Why "PathShiftPeople"?

**[[Founders|PathShiftPeople's founders]], like most people we know, have already had to "shift path" several times over the past few decades.** 

Sometimes shifting path means taking a new direction in your professional life, sometimes it's more personal. Sometimes it's your choice, sometimes it's imposed. 

Whatever the cause, _shift happens_. And with the arrival of Large Language Models today, and AGI sometime down the road, it's happening more frequently. 

While all of us are currently shifting path in response to generative AI, it's early days, and **we're all starting from different places**. Mathew, for example, has been integrating ChatGPT into his public library and personal productivity system, while Pete's been ??? and Wendy's been ???.

That means we're all **"fractional AI experts"**: experts in applying AI to our particular fields of expertise. And AI is so new that we've each discovered something few if anyone else knows. By the same token, we all have a lot to learn from each other. And we're all just getting started.

## So is it all about AI?

**While generative AI will probably drive a lot of the content on this site, we have a *change* focus, not a technology focus.**

AI will doubtless drive a lot of change in 2024 and beyond, forcing many if not most of us to adapt. 

**However, it doesn't follow that everyone must become an AI expert.** Some of us definitely will, and we'll figure out how to help everyone else in our respective industries adapt. After all, we didn't all become IT support staff and software engineers when computers appeared on our desks - some of us did, and everyone else figured out how to use them. 

Something similar will happen with AI, but adapting and adopting AIs into our *existing* workplaces and organisations is only the first shift we will all need to make. Before that's even complete we can expect **second order shifts** to start appearing. 

It's too early to predict what they will be, but the history of innovation suggests they are inevitable: once AI is embedded into today's organisations and products, the possibilities for further innovation will be mind-boggling.

Which is why the single greatest skill you can have is how to shift paths.

## What happens if I miss a lesson? Or three?
Most courses are composed of materials which you can take in your own time, interspersed with live meetings where you can ask questions and exchange ideas. Missing one of these "live lessons" would therefore be a shame, but:

- all live meetings should be recorded, if all participants' consent can be obtained, so you should be able to watch the meeting later
- in some circumstances we can give you credit to join the lesson in a subsequent course.

In all cases, just talk to your course leader.


## Do you offer bundles?
Yes, but not yet.  
However, if you buy a course now we'll give you a discount on future courses, so you will effectively be getting a bundle.

## Can I purchase a gift course or bundle for a friend?

Not yet, but we are working on it. Please contact us and we will set it up for you.

## Do you have a newsletter? Where can I follow you?

See [[ML Follow our journey 2024]].


## How do I add my products and services to the PSP catalogue? Then what happens?

Our current model is that we will help you:
* figure out how to package your expertise so that it complements the rest of our catalogue
* integrate the resulting product(s) into the rest of the catalogue and help you market it 
* learn from other experts, combining their insights with your experience to create new knowledge and products.

You might also be able to contribute as a guest - for example, to an existing product, our Substack or (planned) podcast.

As we point out in [[ML About PSP (2024)]], we are developing PSP with the garage door up, so this model will almost certainly evolve. There are therefore no complex forms to fill in: reach out and contact us (below), and let us know what you think you may have to offer.

## How do I contact you?
If you are taking a course you can reach out to the teacher via the community as well as during any online workshops and webinars.  
For all other questions, please email support@pathshiftpeople.com.
